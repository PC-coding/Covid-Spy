# COVID-Spy
    A web application engineered and designed to be a COVID-19 Tracking App  
    using React and Flask. This app was created to provide a more visual and  
    easily comprehensible way to digest this data. 

# What I Learned
    * Using multiple API calls to update UI.
    * Reinforced knowledge of API integration.
    * Created backend database after parsing the API to store COVID data and  
    user information. 
    * Created user authentication functionality.
    * Leaflet.js / Chart.js libraries were used to create the interactive map and  
    responsive line graph components. 
    * CSS and Material-UI libraries were used to design animations and web layout.
